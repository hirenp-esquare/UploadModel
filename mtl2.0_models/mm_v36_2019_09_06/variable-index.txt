Appointment Slots % (with X waiver)	The proportion of the team's total appointment slots where the provider has a DEA X waiver and thus can provide evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD, calculated from the team's data. An X waivered clinician may also provide other treatments in these slots. (pct)

AUD % Slots Allocated to Each Diagnosis (w X)	The allocation of slots is determined by the team's data (default), but can instead be set manually by users.
AUD Actual Missed Appointment %	The average percent of appointments missed, based on the team's data. The user can also enter their own percentage. (pct)
AUD Actual RVI	The average wait time for new patients is based on the number of patients waiting and how many start care coordination each week (based on Littleâ€™s Law). If there is more demand for completing appointments than there is available capacity, then actual return visit interval will increase, even if the desired RVI doesn't change. If the completing appointment rate drops to zero, then the wait is technically infinite. In the model, appointments are never cancelled due to high wait times, but for ease of display, Actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 weeks).
AUD Adjusted New Patient Wait Time (median)	It is possible for the estimate for the median new patient wait time to be zero, if the team sees many walk-in patients. However the Target New Patient Wait Time needs to be an average, thus a value of zero is not feasible. In these rare cases, we prevent the model from using a zero average wait time, instead using the Minimum Time to Schedule. If the relevant start rate is zero (indicating no patients follow this pathway), then the wait time is also set to zero.
AUD Appointment Slots Reserved for New Patients	The number of additional appointments offered each week to new patients, with the assumption that the team currently has no such carve-outs. Any increase in supply for new patients comes from reducing appointments offered in other services. (appts/wk)

AUD Completing Rate	Appointment completions are based on the team either satisfying all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply). If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase. This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.  (appt/wk)
AUD Current Appointment Supply	appts available for patient care depend on the total number of appointments offered, how those appointments are allocated across the diagnostic cohorts, and the additional appointments squeezed into the schedule through overbooking.
AUD Desired Appointment Completion Rate	The desired completion rate depends on the number of appointments to complete and the return visit interval that was used when those appointments were booked.
AUD Effect of Wait Time on Referrals	When the wait time to start medication management increases above the target wait time for patients with a specific diagnosis, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient with that diagnosis. This effect only applies to above-target wait times: lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm. (pct)

AUD Minimum Time to Schedule	The fastest possible time to schedule a new patient appointment.
AUD New Patient Wait Time	The average wait time for new patients to start in medication management, based on the number of patients waiting and the rate at which they start service. It is capped at 24 weeks (6 months). (wks)

AUD Referral Rate	The number of patients referred to medication management in this team each week. This rate is estimated from the team's supply and historical new patient wait time. (pts/wk)
AUD Referral Rate inferred from Data	Sets the base referral rate to ensure that the number of patients waiting to start Care Coordination is not increasing or decreasing, but reflects the new patient wait time estimated from the team's data. This stable number of patients waiting to start allows the user to see the relative effects of their experiments on new patient wait time.
AUD Relative RVI	The relative RVI for each diagnosis, normalized to sum to 100%.
AUD Rescheduling Rate	The rescheduling rate depends on the total number of appointments to reschedule and the average time it takes to reschedule them. (appts/wk)

The default value for return visit interval is based on the team's data, unless the team chooses to use the data for New Patient Start Rate instead. If the user inputs their desired RVI, then the model uses that value instead.
AUD RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).
AUD Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time	This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time decreases). A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and referrals. A value of "1" indicates that if the new patient wait time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original value). (pct)
AUD Slots Allocation % (with X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider has a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is possible in these slots, but clinicians may provide other treatments in these slots. (pct)
AUD Slots Allocation % (without X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is not possible in these slots. (pct)
AUD Slots Allocation (with X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider has a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 100%. (pct)
AUD Slots Allocation (without X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 1. For providers without X-Waivers, they should not allocate any time to OUD treatment, thus the value for the third % should always be zero. (pct)
AUD Starting Rate	The number of patients who start each week is either, 1) based on how much of the team's total supply remains after all existing patients are seen (plus any additional appointments set aside for new patients), or 2) the team's historical new patient start rate, regardless of supply. (pts/wk)

OtherNeeds Median Engagement	The median number of weeks that patients stay engaged with the team, receiving medication management visits, calculated from the team's data. These visits can be with any member of the team. This engagement time represents a patient's entire engagement in medication management across treatment episodes, regardless of small gaps in service and missed appointments. (wks)
OtherNeeds Minimum Time to Schedule	The fastest possible time to schedule a new patient appointment.
OtherNeeds New Patient Wait Time	The average wait time for new patients to start in medication management, based on the number of patients waiting and the rate at which they start service. It is capped at 24 weeks (6 months). (wks)
OtherNeeds New Patient Wait Time (median)	The new patient wait time, calculated from the teams' data on the time between each patient's first medication management appointment being scheduled and that visit being completed with this team. (wks)
OtherNeeds Normalized % Patients by Diagnosis (no X)	The relative ratios of patients with each diagnosis, normalized to sum to 100%.
OtherNeeds Normalized % Patients by Diagnosis (w X)	The relative ratios of patients with each diagnosis, normalized to sum to 100%.
OtherNeeds Normalized % Slots Allocated (no X w RVI)	The relative amount of provider time spent in appointments focused on each diagnosis, taking relative differences in RVI into account, normalized to sum to 100%.
OtherNeeds Normalized % Slots Allocated (w X w RVI)	The relative amount of provider time spent in appointments focused on each diagnosis, taking relative differences in RVI into account, normalized to sum to 100%.
OtherNeeds Overbooks	The number of additional appointments offered each week (above the official appointment supply). These additional appointments come at the expense of non-patient facing care (e.g., team coordination, reminder calls, treatment planning, etc.). (appts/wk)
OtherNeeds Patient Start Rate based on Supply and RVI and Missed Appt% and Engagement Duration	
OtherNeeds Patients in MM	The total number of patients in medication management. (pts)
OtherNeeds Patients per Appointment	Always 1 patient per appointment, except for group visits.
OtherNeeds Perceived Wait Time	Clinicians' perception of care delays for starting new patients.
OtherNeeds Ratio of Appts for Existing Pts	
OtherNeeds Ratio of Appts for New Pts	
OtherNeeds Ratio of Appts for New Pts w/DataRVI	for Sim UI
OtherNeeds Referral Rate	The number of patients referred to medication management in this team each week. This rate is estimated from the team's supply and historical new patient wait time. (pts/wk)
OtherNeeds Referral Rate inferred from Data	Sets the base referral rate to ensure that the number of patients waiting to start Care Coordination is not increasing or decreasing, but reflects the new patient wait time estimated from the team's data. This stable number of patients waiting to start allows the user to see the relative effects of their experiments on new patient wait time.
OtherNeeds Relative RVI	The relative RVI for each diagnosis, normalized to sum to 100%.
OtherNeeds Rescheduling Rate	The rescheduling rate depends on the total number of appointments to reschedule and the average time it takes to reschedule them. (appts/wk)
OtherNeeds Return Visit Interval	The scheduled average return to clinic visit interval, regardless of whether or not the team has enough supply for the patient demand or the effect on new patient starts. This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. (wks)
OtherNeeds Return Visit Interval (median)	The median return-to-clinic visit interval for medication management visits with this team, calculated from the team's data on the number of visits per patient over their entire engagement time. (wks)
OtherNeeds RVI used when Booking	The team's goal to see each patient in this service once in every x weeks. The default value for return visit interval is based on the team's data, unless the team chooses to use the data for New Patient Start Rate instead. If the user inputs their desired RVI, then the model uses that value instead.
OtherNeeds RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).
OtherNeeds Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time	This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time decreases). A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and referrals. A value of "1" indicates that if the new patient wait time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original value). (pct)
OtherNeeds Slots Allocation % (with X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider has a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is possible in these slots, but clinicians may provide other treatments in these slots. (pct)
OtherNeeds Slots Allocation % (without X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is not possible in these slots. (pct)
OtherNeeds Slots Allocation (with X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider has a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 100%. (pct)
OtherNeeds Slots Allocation (without X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 1. For providers without X-Waivers, they should not allocate any time to OUD treatment, thus the value for the third % should always be zero. (pct)
OtherNeeds Starting Rate	The number of patients who start each week is either, 1) based on how much of the team's total supply remains after all existing patients are seen (plus any additional appointments set aside for new patients), or 2) the team's historical new patient start rate, regardless of supply. (pts/wk)
OtherNeeds Starting Rate (mean)	The number of new patients starting with the team per week, calculated from the team's data. It is based on the average number of patients seen for medication management in one year who have never had a medication management visit with this team before. (pts/wk)
OtherNeeds Target New Patient Wait Time	The acceptable average wait time for new patients to start Care Coordination, based on the team's data. The user can also enter their own new patient wait time goal.
OtherNeeds Target Wait Time	The average new patient wait time acceptable to referring providers. This replaces the value estimated from the team's data. (wks)
OtherNeeds Time to Perceive Wait Time	Time to measure, report, and respond to differences between desired and actual Return Visit Interval for a service. Set to 4 weeks, i.e., a monthly staff meeting update.
OtherNeeds Time to Reschedule	Average time to reschedule an appointment that was missed is estimated at 2 weeks, accounting for large variation in time to make productive contact with the patient and their availability.
OtherNeeds True Missed Appointment %	The proportion of medication management appointments with this team that no-showed or were cancelled after the appointment was supposed to have happened, calculated from the team's data. (pct)
OtherNeeds True Missed Appointment Rate	The number of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment, calculated from the team's data. (appts/wk)
OtherNeeds User Median Engagement	Manually adjust the median number of weeks that patients receive care coordination visits with the team. (wks)
OtherNeeds User-defined Referral Rate	The number of new patient referrals to the team for care coordination each week. This replaces the value estimated from the team's data. (pts/wk)
OtherNeeds User-defined True Missed Appointment %	The proportion of total appointments that are missed and rescheduled (i.e., rework). This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. Allowing different entries for each primary diagnosis assumes that the team can target their efforts to reducing missed appointments on particular cohorts. (pct)
OtherNeeds Waiting to Start	The total number of patients waiting to start medication management. (pts)
OUD % Slots Allocated (no X w RVI)	The relative amount of provider time spent in appointments focused on each diagnosis, taking relative differences in RVI into account.
OUD % Slots Allocated (w X w RVI)	The relative amount of provider time spent in appointments focused on each diagnosis, taking relative differences in RVI into account.
OUD % Slots Allocated to Each Diagnosis (no X)	The allocation of slots is determined by the team's data (default), but can instead be set manually by users.
OUD % Slots Allocated to Each Diagnosis (w X)	The allocation of slots is determined by the team's data (default), but can instead be set manually by users.
OUD Actual Missed Appointment %	The average percent of appointments missed, based on the team's data. The user can also enter their own percentage. (pct)
OUD Actual RVI	The average wait time for new patients is based on the number of patients waiting and how many start care coordination each week (based on Littleâ€™s Law). If there is more demand for completing appointments than there is available capacity, then actual return visit interval will increase, even if the desired RVI doesn't change. If the completing appointment rate drops to zero, then the wait is technically infinite. In the model, appointments are never cancelled due to high wait times, but for ease of display, Actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 weeks).
OUD Adjusted New Patient Wait Time (median)	It is possible for the estimate for the median new patient wait time to be zero, if the team sees many walk-in patients. However the Target New Patient Wait Time needs to be an average, thus a value of zero is not feasible. In these rare cases, we prevent the model from using a zero average wait time, instead using the Minimum Time to Schedule. If the relevant start rate is zero (indicating no patients follow this pathway), then the wait time is also set to zero.
OUD Appointment Slots Reserved for New Patients	The number of additional appointments offered each week to new patients, with the assumption that the team currently has no such carve-outs. Any increase in supply for new patients comes from reducing appointments offered in other services. (appts/wk)
OUD Appointments Available for New Patients	Appointments available for new patients is the remaining supply of appointments, after demand from existing patients is satisfied. The user can also set aside ADDITIONAL appointments specifically for new patients. It is constrained from going below zero.
OUD Appointments for Existing Patients	The number of appointments used by existing patients each week. The team either satisfies all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or uses all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply), leaving no appointments available for new patients. (appt/wk)
OUD Appointments in MM	The total number of medication management appointments on the calendar. (appts)
OUD Appointments to Reschedule	The number of appointments to be rescheduled. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled. (appts)

OUD Appts for New Pts	
OUD Appts for New Pts w/DataRVI	for Sim UI
OUD Booking Rate	The booking rate combines demand from both existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) and new patients' first appointments. (appt/wk)
OUD Completing Rate	Appointment completions are based on the team either satisfying all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply). If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase. This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.  (appt/wk)
OUD Current Appointment Supply	appts available for patient care depend on the total number of appointments offered, how those appointments are allocated across the diagnostic cohorts, and the additional appointments squeezed into the schedule through overbooking.
OUD Desired Appointment Completion Rate	The desired completion rate depends on the number of appointments to complete and the return visit interval that was used when those appointments were booked.
OUD Effect of Wait Time on Referrals	When the wait time to start medication management increases above the target wait time for patients with a specific diagnosis, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient with that diagnosis. This effect only applies to above-target wait times: lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm. (pct)
OUD Ending Rate	The number of patients finishing medication management is a function the number of patients in treatment and their median time engaged in treatment. (pts/wk)
OUD Engagement Duration	Manually adjust the median number of weeks that patients receive medication Management visits with the team. (wks)

The default value for return visit interval is based on the team's data, unless the team chooses to use the data for New Patient Start Rate instead. If the user inputs their desired RVI, then the model uses that value instead.
OUD RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).
OUD Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time	This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time decreases). A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and referrals. A value of "1" indicates that if the new patient wait time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original value). (pct)
OUD Slots Allocation % (with X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider has a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is possible in these slots, but clinicians may provide other treatments in these slots. (pct)
OUD Slots Allocation % (without X waiver)	The proportion of appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X waiver, calculated from the team's data. Providing evidence-based pharmacotherapy for OUD is not possible in these slots. (pct)
OUD Slots Allocation (with X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider has a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 100%. (pct)
OUD Slots Allocation (without X waiver)	The % of the team's total appointment slots allocated to each diagnosis, for clinics where the provider does not have a DEA X-Waiver. These values replaces the base case value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is possible, but they must sum to 1. For providers without X-Waivers, they should not allocate any time to OUD treatment, thus the value for the third % should always be zero. (pct)
OUD Starting Rate	The number of patients who start each week is either, 1) based on how much of the team's total supply remains after all existing patients are seen (plus any additional appointments set aside for new patients), or 2) the team's historical new patient start rate, regardless of supply. (pts/wk)
OUD Starting Rate (mean)	The number of new patients starting with the team per week, calculated from the team's data. It is based on the average number of patients seen for medication management in one year who have never had a medication management visit with this team before. (pts/wk)

SAVEPER	The frequency with which output is stored.
Sensitivity of Changes in Other MM Tasks Time on Missed Appointments	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in time for non-patient-facing care tasks has on missed appointments. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect (raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%). (pct)
